There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. --- C.A.R. Hoare, The 1980 ACM Turing Award Lecture

有两种软件设计的方式：一种是使它足够简单以致于明显没有缺陷，另一种则是使它足够复杂以致于没有明显的缺陷。

The computing scientist's main challenge is not to get confused by the complexities of his own making.  ---E.W.Dijkstra

计算科学家的主要挑战是不要被他自己造成的复杂性搞糊涂了。

------

The cheapest, fastest, and most reliable components are those that aren't there. ---Gordon Bell

最廉价，最快速，并且最可靠的部件是那些还没被使用的

One of my most productive days was throwing away 1000 lines of code. --- `Ken Thompson <http://genius.cat-v.org/ken-thompson/>`_

我最多产的一天抛弃了1000行代码。

------

When in doubt, use brute force. --- `Ken Thompson <http://genius.cat-v.org/ken-thompson/>`_

若无把握，暴力破解。

Deleted code is debugged code. --- Jeff Sickel

需要调试的代码都应该删除。

Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.  --- `Brian W. Kernighan <http://genius.cat-v.org/brian-kernighan/>`_ and P. J. Plauger in `The Elements of Programming Style <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0070342075?ie=UTF8&tag=catv-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0070342075>`_

调试的难度两倍于一开始的写代码。因此，如果你尽可能巧妙地编写代码，根据定义，说明你还不具备足够的智商来调试它。

------

The most effective debugging tool is still careful thought, coupled with judiciously placed print statements. --- `Brian W. Kernighan <http://genius.cat-v.org/brian-kernighan/>`_ , in the paper Unix for Beginners(1979)

最有效的调试工具是静下心来仔细思考，辅之审慎地放置打印语句。

Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming. --- `Brian Kernighan <http://genius.cat-v.org/brian-kernighan/>`_

计算机编程的本质是控制复杂度。

------

Beauty is more important in computing than anywhere else in technology because software is so complicated. Beauty is the ultimate defence against complexity. --- David Gelernter

相比其他技术领域，美对于计算来说更为重要，因为软件超乎寻常的复杂，而美是对复杂性的一种终极防御。

------

UNIX was not designed to stop its users from doing stupid things, as that would also stop them from doing clever things. --- Doug Gwyn

UNIX并不会阻止用户干蠢事，因为那样也会阻碍用户做些聪明的事情。

------

If you're willing to restrict the flexibility of your approach, you can almost always do something better. --- John Carmack

限制方法的灵活性几乎总会让你把事情做得更好。

------

And folks, let's be honest. Sturgeon was an optimist. Way more than 90% of code is crap. --- viro [http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0310.0/0870.html]

同志们啊，诚实一点。Sturgeon是个乐观主义者，其实远超过90%的代码都是垃圾。

------

A data structure is just a stupid programming language. --- R. Wm. Gosper

数据结构就是笨拙的编程语言。(译注：好吧，我承认，其实我并不懂这话的意思)

------

The essence of `XML <http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/xml/>`_ is this: the problem it solves is not hard, and it does not solve the problem well. --- Phil Wadler, POPL 2003

XML的实质就是：问题并不难，它也没有解决好。

------

A program that produces incorrect result twice as fast is infinitely slower. --- John Osterhout

结果不对，程序再快都顶个屁用。

------

Life is too short to run proprietary software. --- Bdale Garbee

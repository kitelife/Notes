- Ruby's Visual Appearance

While Ruby often uses very limited punctuation and usually prefers English keywords, some punctuation is used to decorate Ruby. Ruby needs no variable declarations. It uses simple naming convertions to denote the scope of variable:

> *var* could be a local variable.

> *@var* is an instance variable.

> *$var* is a global variable.
